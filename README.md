# Racket Playground

A set of examples, tools, and utilities for exploration of the [Racket Language](https://racket-lang.org/).

* `examples/` - small things
* `jupyter/` - interactive things
* `packages/`:
  * `simple-bitmap/` - an example package, complete with scribble. This is a first attempt at a pedagogical package with full tests and documentation.
